# Neural Net XOR Logic Implementation using NAND, OR, and AND Gates

This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of the XOR logic gate using combinations of NAND, OR, and AND gates. XOR (exclusive OR) is a fundamental logic gate that returns true (1) if exactly one of its inputs is true (1), and false (0) otherwise. The program showcases the concept of building a neural network-like structure with basic logical components to solve a specific problem.

Key Features:

Defines a step activation function to simulate neuron firing.
Implements a neuron function that calculates weighted sums and applies the step function.
Utilizes predefined weight vectors for NAND, OR, and AND gates.
Iterates through input combinations {0, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, 1}, and {1, 1}.
Computes XOR gate outputs using the combined logic of NAND, OR, and AND gates.
Prints input pairs and corresponding XOR results.
This program serves as an educational example of how neural networks can be constructed using simple logic gates to solve complex problems. It highlights the power of combining basic components to perform intricate computations.
